## General Information

Website for counting dart scores. Project done for a training. The main goal of the project is to create a simple website that will be used to calculate the dart scores. The website is based on Bootstrap, so it can be used on various devices. For a better look, CSS properties such as tranistion & transform were used. Calculation of the results is to be done using JS. I am currently working on a 501 single player game mode. Currently, only on it you can see how it works.



## Technologies Used
- HTML 5,
- CSS 3,
- Bootstrap 5.2,
- JavaScript ES6,



## Project Status
Project is: in progress.

So far, the layout of the page has been created. I am currently working on a JS script that will allow me to calculate the results. The current status can be checked in mode 501 for one player.



## Further development

First, the JS script will be completed, allowing the calculation of the results. Then the script will be implemented into multiplayer modes. In the next step, the script will be adapted to the game mode 301. In the next part, a script will be developed that will allow you to print the sum of throws from consecutive queues. Next, it is planned to create a script to calculate statistics such as average throws and percentage of doubles.
